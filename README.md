# 🧩 Accessible React Form Builder (Under development)
A drag-and-drop form builder built with React that generates accessible, production-ready components.

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 Visual editor – drag & drop inputs, selects, checkboxes, radios, and textareas
- ♿ Accessibility first – automatic labels, ARIA attributes, and color-contrast checks
- ⚡ Code generation – export fully functional React components or JSON schema
- 💾 Persistence – save/load forms from local storage
- 📱 Responsive – works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

## 🚀 Why it’s cool
Most form builders ignore accessibility. This tool ensures WCAG-compliant forms by default, while giving developers exportable React code they can drop straight into projects.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- SCSS (styling)
- pragmatic-drag-and-drop (drag & drop)
- axe-core (a11y auditing)
