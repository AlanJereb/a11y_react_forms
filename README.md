# ðŸ§© Accessible React Form Builder
A drag-and-drop form builder built with React that generates accessible, production-ready components.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸŽ¨ Visual editor â€“ drag & drop inputs, selects, checkboxes, radios, and textareas
- â™¿ Accessibility first â€“ automatic labels, ARIA attributes, and color-contrast checks
- âš¡ Code generation â€“ export fully functional React components or JSON schema
- ðŸ’¾ Persistence â€“ save/load forms from local storage
- ðŸ“± Responsive â€“ works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

## ðŸš€ Why itâ€™s cool
Most form builders ignore accessibility. This tool ensures WCAG-compliant forms by default, while giving developers exportable React code they can drop straight into projects.
